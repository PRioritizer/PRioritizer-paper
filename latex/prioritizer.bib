@inproceedings{GZSD15,
	Abstract = {In the pull-based development model, the integrator has the
  crucial role of managing and integrating contributions. This work focuses on
  the role of the integrator and investigates working habits and challenges
  alike. We set up an exploratory qualitative study involving a large-scale
  survey involving 749 integrators, to which we add quantitative data from the
  integrator's project. Our results provide insights into the factors they
  consider in their decision making process to accept or reject a contribution.
  Our key findings are that integrators struggle to maintain the quality of
  their projects and have difficulties with prioritizing contributions that are
  to be merged.},
