\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

From the results it is evident that the service needs more fine tuning and improvement.
Some features in the training data set are defined in a trivial way, like the test code and PR type detection.
These are limited in their effectiveness.
The prediction model is also clearly dominated, and possibly limited, by one feature in particular, the age of a PR.
Furthermore, the service relies heavily on the \ghtorrent project.
This enables retrieval of large portions of GitHub data, but only for public repositories, not for private repositories.
As a consequence it is not possible to prioritize private repositories at the moment.
