\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
The prediction model needs more features with similar predictive powers as the age of a PR.
Maybe that features aimed at the actual PR contents i.e.\ the code changes can achieve this.
In our work we trained one model per project, but it is reasonable to train a prioritization model for a specific domain, e.g. a developer or integrator.
This enables automatic triage.
Our model predicts which PR needs an action soon, but it is also possible to train a model that predicts or recommends which action (close, merge, comment, review) is required on a PR.
Finally, the project's integrators knows best what is important and what is less important.
It should be possible to collect and use their real-time feedback as input for the model to improve its performance.
